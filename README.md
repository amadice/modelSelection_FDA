# modelSelection_FDA
Here, our project deals with the selection model when we have functional data by using the model-based clustering method, called [FunFEM](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/funFEM/index.html). And we apply our study on CO2 Emissions Dataset (Data from The World Bank) to cluster the countries according to CO2 emission in the world.
