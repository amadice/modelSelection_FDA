# modelSelection_FDA
Here, our project deals with the selection model when we have functional data by using the model-based clustering method, called FunFEM. And we apply our study on CO2 Emissions Dataset (Data from The World Bank) to cluster the countries according to CO2 emission in the world.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on  [CO2 emissions](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC).

## Install

This project requires R software 6 and the following Python libraries installed:
